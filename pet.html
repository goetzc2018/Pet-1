  My pet's name is <u><i><b>Payton</b></i></u>, she is a Labradore. I got Payton for christmas about two years ago. We got her about two months after she was born and she is about 2 years old now. Everytime someone comes to our house she jumps on them with joy. It does not matter if she has known you all her life or juts met you. We swear she even smiles sometimes. She is always happy and she sleeps a lot.
